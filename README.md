## Design

### Color Scheme

    - The Orchid Pink color brings a touch of femininity and elegance to the design and adds warmth and a welcoming feel to the overall aesthetic.

### Bugs

- ##### Solved bugs
  - During the coding process, I encountered a challenge where the images were unresponsive on mobile devices, causing text distortion. Resolving this, I adjusted the height and width properties appropriately. 
  - Another issue arose with non-functional "Contact Us" buttons, which was swiftly addressed by correcting the HTML tags. 
  - Additionally, I had to switch some section tags to div tags to ensure proper validation. Each bug provided a learning opportunity, enhancing the overall functionality of the website.
  ***
- ##### Unsolved bugs
  - There's a bug in the code where users can pick a date from the past. To fix this, we need to use JavaScript, which follows in the future.
