                <h3>De-shedding treatments</h3>
                <p>De-shedding is a process that removes the hair from your dog's undercoat, which may not be
                    effectively removed during the brushing or combing process. The brushing process tends to only
                    remove the hair and debris from the top layer of fur. Unless you enjoy having your house filled
                    with hair, putting your dog through a de-shedding process is advisable. This service is usually
                    packaged alongside others, such as bathing and trimming. </p>

                <h3>Teeth brushing</h3>
                <p>Like us, it is necessary to brush your dog's teeth a few times a week. Brushing their teeth will
                    remove any plaque and prevent tartar accumulation. Teeth brushing is an additional service you
                    can expect to see, so not every professional grooming service will have it on their list. That
                    said, it's crucial that you deep clean your dog's teeth for hygienic reasons. While you could do
                    it yourself, it is best to have a professional perform this routine until your dog becomes more
                    comfortable with getting its teeth clean frequently.</p>

                <h3>Eye and ear cleaning</h3>
                <p>The eyes and ears cleaning is another service you can choose from their list of services. Since these
                    are some very sensitive spots, most dog owners would hesitate to perform it, hence the reason why
                    groomers offer it as an option. Dog's tend to get the same gunk around their eyes just like we do,
                    but they don't have the luxury to wipe it away as we do. Dog groomers use a cotton ball or wipes to
                    carefully clean away the gunk and tear stains gathered around the eyes.</p>

                <h3>Nail trimming</h3>
                <p>Trimming the nails of your dogs is crucial for their overall health. However, nail trimming is
                    something that most dog owners are not skilled enough to perform themselves. So, they hire a groomer
                    to do the nail trimming for them. Similar to a human nail, if your dog's nail gets damaged or hurt,
                    it could cause them pain. One possible cause for a dog's pain is during the trimming process if not
                    maintained frequently. Not only does cutting a dog's nail too short cause them pain but leaving them
                    to grow too long can be even more painful. </p>
